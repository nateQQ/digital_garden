# Note
- Story helps because it is a sense-making mechanism. Essentially, story formulas put everything in order so the brain doesn’t have to work to understand what’s going on
- The first mistake brands make is they fail to focus on the aspects of their offer that will help people **survive** and **thrive**
- The second mistake brands make is they cause their customers to burn too many calories in an effort to understand their offer -> **KISS**
- Clear communication / **CLARIFY YOUR MESSAGE**
- In a story
	- audiences must always know who the hero is
	- what the hero wants
	- who the hero has to defeat to get what they want
	- what tragic thing will happen if the hero doesn’t win
	- and what wonderful thing will happen if they do.
- If you confuse, you’ll lose
- Story is the greatest weapon we have to combat noise
- customer-centric, simple and relevant
- Apple 
	- (1) identifying what their customers wanted (to be seen and heard), 
	- (2) defining their customers’ challenge (that people didn’t recognize their hidden genius)
	- (3) offering their customers a tool they could use to express themselves (computers and smartphones)
- People don’t buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand the fastest
## The Questions
1. What do you offer?  
2. How will it make my life better? 
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

# Storybrand 7-part Framework (SB7)
A Character / Has a Problem / And Meets a Guide / who gives them a plan / and calls them to action / that helps them avoid failure / and ends in a success

A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters a **PROBLEM** before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a **GUIDE** steps into their lives, gives them a **PLAN**, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**. That action helps them avoid **FAILURE** and ends in a **SUCCESS**.

## A Character
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">THE CUSTOMER IS THE HERO, NOT YOUR BRAND.</mark>
- A major paradigm shift in the SB7 Framework is that the customer is the hero of the story, not your brand
- The catalyst for any story is that the hero wants something. The rest of the story is a journey about discovering whether the hero will get what they want.
## Has a Problem 
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">COMPANIES TEND TO SELL SOLUTIONS TO EXTERNAL PROBLEMS, BUT CUSTOMERS BUY SOLUTIONS TO INTERNAL PROBLEMS.</mark>
- Customers are attracted to us for the same reason heroes are pulled into stories: they want to solve a problem that has, in big or small ways, disrupted their peaceful life.
- By talking about the problems our customers face, we deepen their interest in everything we offer.
- In stories, heroes encounter external, internal, and philosophical problems
## And Meets a Guide
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">CUSTOMERS AREN’T LOOKING FOR ANOTHER HERO; THEY’RE LOOKING FOR A GUIDE.</mark>
- Each day is, quite literally, about how we encounter our world. Potential customers feel the same way about themselves. They are the center of their world.
- When a brand comes along and positions itself as the hero, customers remain distant.
## Who Gives Them a Plan
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">CUSTOMERS TRUST A GUIDE WHO HAS A PLAN.</mark>
- the guide gives the hero a plan, or a bit of information, or a few steps they can use to get the job done.
- two kinds of plans: the agreement plan and the process plan
## And Calls them to Action
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">CUSTOMERS DO NOT TAKE ACTION UNLESS THEY ARE CHALLENGED TO TAKE ACTION.</mark>
- characters don’t take action on their own. They must be challenged.
- characters only take action after they are challenged by an outside force.
- 
## That helps them avoid Failure
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">EVERY HUMAN BEING IS TRYING TO AVOID A TRAGIC ENDING</mark>
- we must show people the cost of not doing business with us.
## And Ends in a Success
<mark class="hltr-yellow-2">NEVER ASSUME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR BRAND CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES. TELL THEM.</mark>
- Everybody wants to be taken somewhere.
