# 5. In search of "Better"

- people don't believe what you believe.
- everyone has noise in their heads.
- quote:: **everything that we purchase - investment, trinket, experience - is a bargain. That's why we bought it.** #quote 
- How do we remember & choose a product? We remember the best one. 
  Best for what? 
  Yep, best for us.
- Your job as a marketer is to find a spot on the map with edges that (some) people want to find.
- Who's it for? What do they **believe**? What do they **want**? #question

# 6. Beyond Commodity

- this is the work that helps people understand that you're special, and this is the work that makes things better.
- find good [[stories]]
- Your [[stories]] are hooks:
	- to deliver
	- for what happens next
	- take it or leave it
- better is up to the users, not up to you #quote

# 7. The Canvas of Dreams and Desires

- quote:: Twenty-dollar bills are meaningless. It's what you can buy with them that we work for. #quote 
- The same is true of your product or service. You may say you're offering a widget, but don't believe it. When you're marketing change, you're offering a new emotional state, a step closer to the dreams and desires of your customers, not a widget.
- **We sell feelings, status, and connection, not tasks or stuff.** #quote 
- people confuses wants and needs; people are intimately aware of their wants (which they think of as needs) but they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants. They often prefer to use a familiar solution to satisfy their wants, even if it's not working very well.
- **Innovative marketers invent new solutions that work with old emotions.** #quote 
- [[dream]] and [[fear]]
- **what people is buying: a feeling, not a product.** #quote 
   Identify that felling before you spend time making a product/ service.

# 8. Seeking the Smallest Viable Market

- you just need to find your own TA.
- true fan spread the word.
- key notes
	- they gave fans **plenty to talk about** & stand for. Insider and outsider.

# 9. People like us do things like this

- for most of us, changing our behavior is driven by **our desire to fit in** (people like us do things like this) and our **perception of our status**.
- Do people like me do things like this? #question -> connection, belonging
- which us?

# 10. Trust and tension create forward motion

- what pattern are you breaking? #question 
	- change means breaking their habit -> the more change, the more effort. -> need more tension
- are you ready to create tension?
	- you can be a cab driver, show up and ask so where they want to go, charge them based on the meter, be a replacable cog in the on-demend transport system.
	- you might be a harder-working cabbie, but it won't change much.
# 11. Status, Dominance, Vernacular
- status
	- status role: determine who gets to eat first in the lion pack, and who gets to drink first at the oasis.
	- is our position in the hierarchy
	- 2 states: 1 is try to maintain the current one, 2 is looking for up/down
	- 2 types:
		- **affiliation**: care about what is around him (who knows you, who trust you, have you made things better, where do you stand within the tribe) -> **Who sits closet to the emperor**
		- **dominion**: care about which can oofer to himself (this is mine, not yours; who has more power, i did this myself,...) -> **Who eats first**
- Different story for different people #quote 

# 12. A Better Business Plan
- [[business plan]]
>5 section: Truth - Assertions - Alternatives - People - Money (TAAPM)

- TRUTH: describe the world as it is
	- about the market you are entering
	- the needs that exist
	- the competitors in your space
	- technology standards
	- how others have succeeded and failed in the past
	> for making sure that you're clear about how you see the world - it just states how things are
	- can include spreadsheets, market share analysis,...

- ASSERTIONS: describe how you're going to change things
	- we will do X, and then Y will happen.
	- we will build Z with this much money in this much time
	- we will present Q to the market, and the market will respond by taking this action.
	- you're creating tension by telling stories #quote 
	> this is the heart of the plan, the only reason to launch a project is to make change, to make things better, and we want to know what you're going to do and what impact it's going to have #quote 

- ALTERNATIVE: what you'll do if shit happends (miss budget, deadlines and sale), how flexibility does the team have,...
- PEOPLE: 
	- your team: who is in? who will join?
	- who are the ppl you're serving?
	- who are the champions?
- most marketers actually have the same "purposes"
	- to be successful
	- to engage w people in a way that benefits both sides
	- to be respected, seen, and appreciated
	- to make enough Ã² a profit to do it again.

# 13. Semiotics, Symbols, and Vernacular
- quote:: we are communicate with **symbols** -> create reminder, pattern #quote 
	- remind, remind, remind, shortcut and shorthand
	- you can do it with intent
- busy people scan, instead of study
- a professional does for you a design something that other ppl will like, create a look and feel that reminds people of their sort of magic.
- what's your flag? why would someone fly it? #question 
- most care ads look the same -> a signal about the car being worth considering
- but fashion ads look different -> the chance to fit in -> vernacular.
- if people care, you've got a brand #quote 

# 14. Treat Different People Differently
- some customers are worth more than others
- you can learn a lot about people by watching what they do, and when you find someone who is adopting your case, adopt them back. When you find SO who is eager to talk about what you do, give him something to talk about.

# 15. Reaching the Right People

> GOAL -> STRATEGY -> TACTICS

- **GOAL**: the change you seek to make in the world
	- it's your shining light, the unwavering destination of your work
- **STRATEGY**: the long-lasting way you're investing in reaching the goal
	- is the way you use stories, status, and connection to create tension and forward motion
	- might be:
		- earn trust + attention
		- to be seen as the best and maybe the only alternative
		- have alliances and partnerships that enable you and your message to reach exactly the right people
- **TACTICS**: the dozens of steps you'll take on behalf of your strategy
	- have many alternative
	- can be changed easily
- Example:
	- Cocacola
		- goal: get more people to drink more Coke
		- strategy: run enormous number of ads to persuade the mass market that Coke was part of the culture that made them happe, and everyone else was drinking it too
- Attention cost
- Brand marketing makes magic, direct marketing makes the phone ring 
	- brand mkt 
		- is culturally oriented, can't be measured
		- be specific, be very very specific
	- direct
- Frequency
	- we remember what we rehearse
	- we remember the things that we see again and again, that we do over and over.
- a smart marketer can build a product or service that's worth searching for
- **Step 1: make a product or service that people care enough to search for specifically
- **Step 2: to be the one they want to find when they go looking***

# 16. Price is a Story

- quote:: Marketing changes your pricing. Pricing changes your marketing.
- Price is a signal.
- best combination:
	- free ideas that spread -> build awareness, permission, and trust -> platform to sell things that are worth paying for
	- expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for
- the story isn't for everyone, but for the right people, it transforms the experience.

# 17. Permission & Remarkability in a Virtuous Cycle

- keyword: pay attention
- if you stop showing up, people are concerned. They ask where you went.
- once you earn permission, you can educate, tell a story, day by day, drip by drip, engage w people.
- don't just talk at them, communicate the info that they want.
- you should own it, not rent it.
- ideas travel horizontally now: from person to person, we begin with the smallest possible core & give them something to talk about, and a reason to do so.

# 18. Trust is as scarce as attention

- three paths: **Ignored** - **Sneaking around** - **Trusted**
- We like to do what everyone else is doing. Everyone else means "everyone like us"
- the early adopters have a huge incentive to bring your idea across the chasm to the masses, it will make their lives better if everyone in their network also uses this idea.
- more people connected, the more power they have.
- people saw which early adopters had, and they want to have it also -> create tension

# 20. Organizing and Leading a Tribe 
- **the story of self** give you standing, a platform from which to speak -> talk about the transition, from used to to became
- **the story of us** is the kernel of a tribe, it's about being together, not apart.
- **the story of now** is the critical pivot -> provide the tension for all to move forward, together
> i was like you, i was in the desert, then i learned something and now i'm here. I'm not alone, i saw you the very pain i saw in myself. Together, we can make this better.

- Example:
	- i used to be fifty pounds overweight. My health was bad, my relationships were worse.
	- then i discovered competitive figure staking. It was tough at first, but thanks to my new friends on the rink, i got to the point where it was fun.
	- i felt good about myself.

- shared interests, shared goals, shared language
- connect members of the tribe, use status roles to elevate a costume,...
- don't say it all, don't make it obvious; easter egg, unknown features
- the tribe is waiting for you to commit.

# 23. Marketing to the Most Important Person

- we bring value to the world when we market. That's why people engage with us.
- make things better.
